# Inter Process Communication (IPC)

To communicate between processes on a same system there is 2 approaches: sharing memory or passing messages through a socket.

The later is the safest of the two (but not exempt of problems) and you will find here the building blocks to communicate via a socket.

**Note**: the adage `share state through messages and not messages through state` is a pillar of the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) and [initially of object oriented programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7erJ1DV_Tlo).

```php
# process acting as a server
use Innmind\Socket\Address\Unix as Address;
use Innmind\TimeContinuum\Earth\ElapsedPeriod;
use Innmind\Immutable\Str;

$server = $os->sockets()->open(Address::of('/tmp/foo'))->match(
    static fn($server) => $server,
    static fn() => throw new \RuntimeException('Unable to start the server'),
);
$watch = $os->sockets()->watch(new ElapsedPeriod(1000))->forRead($server);

while (true) {
    $watch()
        ->flatMap(static fn($ready) => $ready->toRead()->find(static fn($socket) => $socket === $stream))
        ->flatMap(static fn($server) => $server->accept())
        ->match(
            static fn($client) => $client
                ->write(Str::of('Hello ðŸ‘‹'))
                ->flatMap(static fn($client) => $client->close())
                ->match(
                    static fn() => null, // everyhting is ok
                    static fn() => throw new \RuntimeException('Unable to send data or close the connection'),
                ),
            static fn() => null, // no new connection available
        );
}
```

```php
# process acting as client
use Innmind\Socket\Address\Unix as Address;
use Innmind\TimeContinuum\Earth\ElapsedPeriod;

$client = $os->sockets()->connectTo(Address::of('/tmp/foo'));
$watch = $os->sockets()->watch(new ElapsedPeriod(1000))->forRead($client);

do {
    $ready = $watch()
        ->flatMap(static fn($ready) => $ready->toRead()->find(static fn($ready) => $ready === $client))
        ->match(
            static fn() => true,
            static fn() => false,
        );
} while (!$ready);

echo $client->read()->match(
    static fn($data) => $data->toString(),
    static fn() => 'unable to read the stream',
);
```

In the case the server is started first then the client would print `Hello ðŸ‘‹`.

**Important**: this is a very rough implementation of communication between processes. **DO NOT** use this simple implementation in your code, instead use a higher level API such as [`innmind/ipc`](https://github.com/innmind/ipc).
